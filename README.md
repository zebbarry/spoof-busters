## Overview

This project implements GPS spoofing detection algorithms using receiver-level metrics. We analyze data from a comprehensive spoofing dataset to identify anomalies and distinguish between authentic and spoofed GPS signals.

## Dataset

We're using the GPS spoofing dataset available at:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nxk9r22wd6/1
